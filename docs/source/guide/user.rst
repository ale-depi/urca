Getting started
---------------

To have fun with URCA, it is enough the following.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 -m venv venv_name
   $ source venv_name/bin/activate
   (venv_name) $ pip install urca

Stay tuned

Note that in order to have the last changes or fixes, you can do the following.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 -m venv venv_name
   $ source venv_name/bin/activate
   (venv_name) $ git clone https://github.com/ale-depi/urca
   (venv_name) $ cd urca
   (venv_name) $ pip install .

From now on, in the virtual environment named ``venv_name`` you can call
``import urca``.
