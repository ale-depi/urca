Getting started
---------------

To have fun with URCA, it is enough the following.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 -m venv lake
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   (lake) $ pip install urca

Last updates
------------

Note that in order to have the last changes or fixes, you can do the following.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 -m venv lake
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   (lake) $ git clone https://github.com/ale-depi/urca
   (lake) $ cd urca
   (lake) $ pip install .

From now on, in the virtual environment named ``lake`` you could call
``import urca``.
